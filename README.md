- Provide as much information possible when opening your ticket.

## Installation & Usage

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Dg8p9up.png" width="600">

- This version supports both Python2 and Python3.

- Note: `play` and `lyrics` commands have been deprecated in the current brach since they were not of much use and created unnecessary clutter. You can still get them back by using `old` branch though.

### Debian, Ubuntu, Linux & Mac

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/Ritiek/Spotify-Downloader
cd Spotify-Downloader
sudo pip install -U -r requirements.txt
sudo apt-get install libav-tools
```
You'll also need to install avconv:

`sudo apt-get install libav-tools` (`brew install libav` for Mac)

Use `sudo python spotdl.py` to launch the script.

### Windows

Assuming you have Python already installed..

- Download Libav-Tools for windows: https://builds.libav.org/windows/release-gpl/libav-x86_64-w64-mingw32-11.7.7z. Copy all the contents of bin folder (of libav) to Scripts folder (in your python's installation directory).

- Download the zip file of this repository and extract its contents in your python's installation folder as well.

Shift+right-click on empty area and open cmd and type:

`"Scripts/pip.exe" install -U -r requirements.txt`

Now to run the script type:

`python.exe spotdl.py`

(you can create a batch file shortcut to run the script just by double-click anytime)

## Instructions for Downloading Songs

- Launch the script using the above command as mentioned for your OS.

- For available options, run `sudo python spotdl.py --help` (or for windows run `python.exe spotdl.py --help`).

#### Downloading by Name

For example

- We want to download Hello by Adele, simply run the script and type `adele hello`.

- The script will automatically look for the best matching song and download it in the folder `Music/` placed in your current directory.

- It will now convert the song to an mp3 and try to fix meta-tags and album-art by looking up on Spotify.

#### Downloading by Spotify Link (Recommended)

For example

- We want to download the same song (i.e: Hello by Adele) but using Spotify Link this time that looks like  `http://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7`, you can copy it from your Spotify desktop or mobile app by right clicking or long tap on the song and copy HTTP link.

- Now simply paste this link after running the script, it should download Hello by Adele.

- Just like before, it will again convert the song to an mp3 but since we used a Spotify HTTP link, the script is guaranteed to fetch the correct meta-tags and album-art.

- Just hit `ctrl+c` to exit out of the script.

#### What if we want to download multiple songs at once?

For example

- We want to download Hello by Adele, The Nights by Avicci and 21 Guns by Green Day just using a single command.

Also this time we have the Spotify link only for Hello by Adele but not for other two songs.

No problem!

- Just make a list.txt by running the following commands:

```
cd
cd Spotify-Downloader
sudo nano list.txt
```
(if you are on windows, just edit `list.txt` - i.e `C:\Python27\list.txt`)

Add all the songs you want to download, in our case it is

```
https://open.spotify.com/track/1MDoll6jK4rrk2BcFRP5i7
the nights avicci
21 guns green day
```

- Now pass `--list` or `-l` to the script, i.e `sudo python spotdl.py --list` and it will start downloading songs mentioned in `list.txt`.

- You can stop downloading songs by hitting `ctrl+c`, the script will automatically resume from the song where you stopped it the next time you want to download the songs present in `list.txt`.

- To download all songs in your playlist, just select all the songs `ctrl+a` in Spotify desktop app, copy them `ctrl+c` and paste `ctrl+v` in `list.txt` and then use `--list` argument.

- Songs that are already downloaded will be skipped and will not be downloaded again.

## FAQ

#### I get system cannot find the specified file when downloading?

Check out these issues [#22](../../issues/22), [#35](../../issues/35), [#36](../../issues/36).

#### How can I download whole playlist with its URI?

Currently this is not possible without generating unique tokens from Spotify but you can copy all the songs from a playlist and paste them in `list.txt`. I am avoiding tokens as much possible to retain the portability of this tool but if you would like to add it as an optional feature to this tool, PR's welcome!

#### You write horrible code. What's wrong with you?

I'm trying...
